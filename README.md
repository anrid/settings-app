# Settings App Demo

A simple [InfernoJS](https://github.com/infernojs/inferno) app that saves user preferences, unapologetically trying to look as similar as possible to the user settings section over at [Fancy.com](https://fancy.com/).

I created this version as an example solution to show those who already completed the full-stack developer interview assignment.

You know who you are ;-)
